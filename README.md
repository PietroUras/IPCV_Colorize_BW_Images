# IPCV_Colorize_BW_Images

## Introduction

This project was developed as part of the "Image Processing and Computer Vision" course at Politecnico di Torino. I chose the topic of black-and-white image colorization to combine my knowledge of OpenCV with a personal goal: colorizing old family photos. 

This project also provided an opportunity to explore neural networks for the first time. While I am aware that more advanced models exist today, I opted to base my work on the 2016 study ["Colorful Image Colorization"](http://richzhang.github.io/colorization/) for simplicity and to gain a better understanding of foundational approaches in this field.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the article ["Black and White Image Colorization with OpenCV and Deep Learning"](https://pyimagesearch.com/2019/02/25/black-and-white-image-colorization-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/) published on PyImageSearch. 

The code in this repository builds upon the concepts and techniques described in the article, with additional modifications and enhancements to suit specific project goals.
Some sections of the code were adapted or derived from examples provided in the article. Please refer to the original article for further details.

## Model Source

The pre-trained Caffe model used in this project was downloaded from the description of the video ["How to Colorize Black and White Photos in Python"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAmskBNz_Vc). 

Special thanks to the video creator for providing the mod
